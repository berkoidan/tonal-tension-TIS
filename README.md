This is an implementation of the paper `A Computational Model of Tonal Tension Profile of Chord Progressions in the Tonal Interval Space` (Navarro-Caceres, 2020)

This paper uses the computational model of TIS (Tonal Interval Space), described in `A Multi-Level Tonal Interval Space for Modelling Pitch Relatedness` (Bernardes, 2016)

Original implementation, based on matlab interperter is published in the following link. This implementation is a conversion to python implementation with additional features
